# ðŸŽ“ Bootcamp Archive: Learning Phase Repositories

This organization houses coursework and projects created during my Data Science and Software Engineering bootcamp training.  
All repositories within this organization are **private** and retained solely for educational reference.

These projects represent my **learning phase**, where I explored core programming concepts, version control workflows, and foundational tools that I now use professionally in backend engineering, data modeling, and quantitative research.

## Why This Organization Exists

- To preserve my early development journey for personal reflection.  
- To maintain a record of structured bootcamp exercises and assignments.  
- To separate guided academic work from my **professional portfolio** hosted in:
  - [Brice-Backend-Projects](https://github.com/Brice-Backend-Projects)
  - [Brice-Financial-Projects](https://github.com/Brice-Financial-Projects)
  - [Brice-Engineering-Projects](https://github.com/Brice-Engineering-Projects)
  - [Brice-Data-Science-Projects](https://github.com/Brice-Data-Science)
  - [Brice-Machine-Learning-Projects](https://github.com/Brice-Machine-Learning)
  - [QuantShift-Lab](https://github.com/QuantShift-Lab)

## Visibility

All repositories here are **private**, meaning:

- No code is visible to the public.  
- The organization remains on my GitHub profile purely as an archived learning space.
